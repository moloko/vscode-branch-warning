# Branch Warnings

Alerts you when you are working on a branch you have designated "protected" such as master. Can help to remember not to commit to the wrong branch.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `branchwarnings.suppressPopup`: Suppress the more intrusive warning dialog when first switching to a protected branch (only show the warning on the status bar).

* `branchwarnings.protectedBranches`: An array of branch names. If it exists, warnings will be shown for these names.

By default, warnings will be given for branches titled "master". If you wish to warn when working on another branch such as "prerelease", add to your workspace or user settings:
```
"branchwarnings.protectedBranches": [ "master", "prerelease", "releases/**" ]
```
